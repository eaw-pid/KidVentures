## Description

KidVentures is a full-stack application using Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript and React. This app is for parents and caregivers who are trying to find activities for their kids in their local communities. Users can signup and view a list of upcoming activities, or use the React Big Calendar to view by day. Users can filter by the activity category, or search for only free activities. When a User selects an activity, they can view the activity on a map using the Google Maps API. Users can also add new activities to create a more robust database of activities. They can interact with the app by leaving comments and reviews for the activities.
